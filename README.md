# SerializationFun

**Practice Serializing Unity Scenes using JSON**

Test Scene is able to show that changes that occur <br />
during runtime will maintain through scene changing <br />

To Run this project Download "TestBuild.zip", extract <br />
the files, and run the SerializationFun Application <br />

Controls for this game are: <br />
- **W :** To go in a door
- **A :** To move left
- **D :** To move right

Other Considerations: <br />
- If you move off of the stage you will have to restart the demo
- There is no built in exit button so you will have to terminate the demo manually
- There is a built in reset button for player prefs
